# Code

The code needed to train the screening and diagnostic models that are in data/models:
screening_model.r
diagnostic_model.r

code needed to compile model scores generated by the models into the files in data/scores and data/tables:
collect_scores.r
allcancer_table_diag.r
allcancer_table_screen.r
hgsoc_table_diag.r
hgsoc_table_screen.r

code needed to compile various data files used for specific figures in analysis:
proteins_screening_model.r - train model using only protein features
Simulation_setup.Rmd - get stage weighted sens/spec for Figure 4
feature_importance.Rmd - compute feature importance for use in Figure 2
